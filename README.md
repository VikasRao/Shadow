# Shadow
Fusion of AI and mobile

This Project integrates TensorFlow Lite, Android, and Arduino technologies  This setup enables Android smartphones to serve as the project's central hub, using their computational prowess to process visual input from cameras. Acting as the 'brain,' the Android device interprets the detected humans and generates precise commands. These commands are then transmitted via Bluetooth to an Arduino-equipped 4WD toy car, and the car flawlessly navigates its surroundings.
